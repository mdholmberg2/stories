    <p>Synopsis</p>
    <p>Liberty is a research scientist in a lob that is deep underground, an old military silo; 
    complex converts to a lab during the Cold War.  Now in civilian use. Liberty is studying 
    historical dna, markers that she believes are not quite human.</p>

    <p>Hugh Mann is a research assistant and works with her in the lab.  
        Hi keeps to himself Liberty notices, never smiles.  She wonders what is up with that.  
        He is good looking though, ever if a bit odd.  He has never told a joke and has never 
        laughed at any joke or participated in idle gossip.</p>

    <p>Alone in his office Hu is speaking to ’76, the construct is reporting the the base on 
        the moon has just been attacked, all the security forces are dear all that has survived 
        is a single maintenance hanger and office complex.  Hu orders the construct to return to 
        Earth and pick him up, he will make an assessment and report to Homeworld.  ’76 reports that 
        communications have been intercepted and sensors indicate that the Tal were approaching Earth. 
        Hu orders ’76 to depart immediately, ’76 is unsure, a construct can only pilot a ship with simple 
        maneuvers, “I am an administrative assistant, I cannot engage in space battles” Hu reassures the 
        construct and tells him to activate stealth mode and to depart immediately. </p>

    <p>Later Hu in his office ’76 appears to shimmer through the walls.  The on on the 25th level below. The 
        klaxons go off and the scientists are evacuating the underground lab.  The warnings are leftover 
        military warning systems of imminent attack.  The scene out side is unbelievable, to humans that is.</p>

    <p>There is and aerial battle taking place, it appeared that three ships were attacking a single 
        ship and that ship was doing badly, indeed.  Hu, as soon as the construct arrived, shimmered to his 
        his ship by use of a device he invented that made use of nspace, a mini nspace projector. The nspace 
        projector was discovered in the ruins on corax and was singularly responsible for the Thuron use of 
        constructs inhabiting nspace, a construct a calculator basically that is projected to real space and 
        appear as 2-dimensional ghostly Images in real space.  The Tal, however, use constructs as controllers 
        on their worlds.</p>

    <p>The battle was finally in Hu’s favor, 2-ships we disintegrated and the other damaged landscaped. Hu’s ship 
        landed in a controlled crash, and he staggered out of the ship and collapsed. Crowds of people were 
        evacuating not seeing the collapsed Hu and not caring except for their own lives.</p>
